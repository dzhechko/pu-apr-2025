# Deep Research v01 Development Plan

## Overview
Deep Research is a multi-agent system designed to provide comprehensive answers to complex research questions using specialized AI agents working sequentially. The system employs a Triage agent for planning, Research agent for information gathering, and Editor agent for compiling coherent reports. The system also features real-time stock price data retrieval using SerpAPI. The user interface is fully localized in Russian with automatic language detection to provide responses in the same language as the query.
