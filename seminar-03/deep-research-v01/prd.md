# PRD: Deep Research v01 - Multi-Agent Internet Research System

## 1. Product overview
### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: Deep Research v01 - Multi-Agent Internet Research System
- Version: 1.2.0

### 1.2 Product summary
Deep Research is a multi-agent system designed to provide comprehensive answers to complex research questions by leveraging specialized AI agents that work together sequentially. The system employs three distinct agents: a Triage agent that plans the research by breaking down questions into specific search queries, a Research agent that collects information from the internet, and an Editor agent that compiles the findings into a coherent report.

The system is designed to make internet research more efficient by automating the process of information gathering, analysis, and synthesis, saving users time and providing them with high-quality, well-structured research reports. The interface is fully localized in Russian, while the system can detect and respond in the same language as the user's query (Russian or English).
